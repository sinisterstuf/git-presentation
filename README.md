*Using git and Eclipse with the EGit and Mylyn plugins.*

A presentation in LaTeX with Beamer, which I wrote to help present how git
can be used to work collaboratively from within the Eclipse IDE.  The
[LaTeX source code](https://github.com/sinisterstuf/git-presentation) is at GitHub
and the [resulting PDF](https://www.sharelatex.com/github/repos/sinisterstuf/git-presentation/builds/latest/output.pdf)
is at ShareLaTeX.
